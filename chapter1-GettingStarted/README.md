## **C Programs**

[a) Ramesh's basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-a.c)

[b) The distance between two cities (in km.) is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert and print this distance in meters, feet, inches and centimeters.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-b.c)

[c) If the marks obtained by a student in five different subjects are input through the keyboard, write a program to find out the aggregate marks and percentage marks obtained by the student. Assume that the maximum marks that can be obtained by a student in each subject is 100.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-c.c)

[d) Temperature of a city in Fahrenheit degrees is input through the keyboard. Write a program to convert this temperature into Centigrade degrees.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-d.c)

[e) The length and breadth of a rectangle and radius of a circle are input through the keyboard. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle, and the area of circumference of the circle.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-e.c)

[f) Paper of size A0 has dimension 1189 x 841 mm. Each subsequent size A(n) is defined as A(n-1) cut in half parallel to the shorter side. Thus paper of size A1 would have dimensions 841 mm x 594 mm. Write a program to calculate and print paper sizes A0, A1, A2, ... A8.](/Chapter1-GettingStarted/main-f.c)
