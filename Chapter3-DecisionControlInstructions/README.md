## **C Programs**

[a) If cost price and selling price of an item are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine whether the seller has made profit or incurred loss. Also determine how much profit he made or loss he incurred.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-a.c)

[b) Any integer is input through the keyboard. Write a program to find out whether it is an odd number or even number.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-b.c)

[c) Any year is input through the keyboard. Write a program to determine whether the year is a leap year or not. (Hint: Use the % (modulus) operator)](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-c.c)

[d) According to the Gregorian calendar, it was Monday on the date 01/01/01. If any year is input through the keyboard write a program to find out what is the day on 1st January of this year.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-d.c)

[e) A five-digit number is entered through the keyboard. Write a program to obtain the reversed number and to determine whether the original and reversed numbers are equal or not.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-e.c)

[f) If the ages of Ram, Shyam and Ajay are input through the keyboard, write a program to determine the youngest of the three.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-f.c)

[g) Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are entered through the keyboard. A traingle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-g.c)

[h) Write a program to find the absolute value of a number entered through the keyboard.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-h.c)

[i) Given the length and breadth of a rectangle, write a program to find whether the area of the rectangle is greater than its perimeter. For example, the area of the rectangle with length = 5 and breadth = 4 is greater than its perimeter.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-i.c)

[j) Given three points (x1,y1),(x2,y2) and (x3,y3), write a program to check if all the three points fall on one straight line.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-j.c)

[k) Given the coordinates(x,y) of center of a circle and its radius, write a program that will determine whether a point lies inside the circle, on the circle or outside the circle. (Hint: Use sqrt() and pow() functions)](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructions/main-k.c)

[l) Given a point(x,y), write a program to find out if it lies on the X-axis, Y-axix or on the origin.](/Chapter3-DecisionControlInstructionss/main-l.c)
